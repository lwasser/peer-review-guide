# pyOpenSci Community Goals 


pyOpenSci has several goals that support the scientific Python open source 
community.

1. **Packages with overlapping functionality:** 
It's easy to find multiple packages on `PyPI` that perform that same tasks (or overlapping tasks). When you submit to us, we ask that you know about other packages in our system that may do similar things. This check will help us connect maintainers who are working on similar goals. It will also help us in the long term reduce the number of overlapping packages, in various states of maintenance on `PyPI`.

1. **Improve package usability:** Documentation makes it easier for scientists to use your tools. Our review process looks at documentation, quick start vignettes (code samples to get started) to make it easier for new users to get started using your package. 

1. **Standardize packaging:** There are many different ways to create a Python 
package. We will embrace community driven standards created by organizations 
such as Scientific Python and help maintainers create more consistent 
infrastructure for their packages. In the long term consistent infrastructure 
will make it easier for new contributors to contribute too.

1. **Long term maintenance:** Most maintainers are not paid and thus work on tools 
in their free time. So what happens when a maintainer of a commonly used tool wants 
to step down? We will help maintainers find someone new to take over the reigns.
If that doesn't make sense we will help the maintainer gracefully sunset the 
package. 

1. The need for community around and support for smaller Python packages that 
support open science.  -->
