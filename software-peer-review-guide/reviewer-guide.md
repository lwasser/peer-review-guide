# Guide for Reviewers


## Why review a package for pyOpenSci? <Move to reviewer guide??>

We hope that you choose to review **to give back to the rOpenSci and scientific communities.**  Our mission to expand the ability to efficiently use scientific data and promote a culture of open reproducible is only possible through the volunteer efforts of community members like you.

-   Peer review is a two-way conversation. By reviewing packages, you'll have the chance to **continue to learn development practices from authors and other reviewers**.
-   The open nature of our review process allows you to **network and meet colleagues and collaborators** through the review process. Our community is friendly and filled with supportive members expert in Python package development, a diversity of science domains and computer science.

### Volunteer to review for us

-   To volunteer to be one of our reviewers, fill out [this short form](https://forms.gle/9dv99gri6XKNU8177). In the form you will provide your contact information and areas of expertise. We are always looking for more reviewers with both general package-writing experience and domain expertise in the fields where packages are used. Some of our reviewers focus on package usability and documentation. This allows you to review even if you don't have strong technical background. We will pair you with a second reviewer that can focus more on the technical aspect of the review. 



```{epigraph}
Thank you for taking the time to review a package for pyOpenSci and for contributing
to making open source scientific software easier to use by the community! If you
have any questions about the review process, feel free to reach out to one of
our editors or to post a question on our [discourse forum](https://pyopensci.discourse.group/).  
```

Please be respectful and kind to the authors in your reviews. Our
[code of conduct](../about-peer-review/code-of-conduct) is mandatory for everyone involved in our
review process.

## A Guide for New Reviewers

% TODO: Add text about the criteria for being a reviewer here ... outline idea below
% * Familiar with Python
% * course review for usability and documentation vs technical reviews
% * we like to have both in each review so it can be split up across multiple reviewers (technical, usability, etc)

## Get Started With Your Review

As a new review you want to start by installing the package that you are
reviewing locally to test it out. You can either fork and install the package in
development mode `pip install -e .` or install from `pip` or `conda-forge`. Be sure
that the version that you are reviewing aligns with the version submitted the
version submitted by the author. The package version can be found at the top of
the review issue. In the example below you can see that pyrolite version 0.2.5
was submitted for review. That is the version that you should install!

```
Submitting Author: Name (@morganjwilliams)
Package Name: pyrolite
One-Line Description of Package: A set of tools for getting the most from your geochemical data.

### General Guidelines For Reviewing A Python Package for PyOpenSci

```{note}
If you are submitting a review, we appreciate submission within 3 weeks of
accepting a review. Please contact the editor directly or in the submission
thread to inform them about possible delays.
```

To review a package, please begin by copying our
[review template](../appendices/templates#review-template) and using it as a
high-level checklist. In addition to checking off the minimum criteria specified
in the review- template, please also provide general comments addressing the following:

- Does the code comply with general principles in the [Mozilla reviewing guide](https://mozillascience.github.io/codeReview/review.html)?
- Does the package comply with the [pyOpenSci packaging guide](../authoring/overview)?
- Are there improvements that could be made to the code style?
- Is there code duplication in the package that should be reduced?
- Are there user interface improvements that could be made?
- Are there performance improvements that could be made?
- Is the documentation (installation instructions/vignettes/examples/demos) clear and sufficient? Does it use the principle of *multiple points of entry* i.e. takes into account the fact that any piece of documentation may be the first encounter the user has with the package and/or the tool/data it wraps?
- Were functions and arguments named to work together to form a common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and autocomplete?
- If you have your own relevant data/problem, work through it with the package. You may find rough edges and use-cases the author didn't think about.

### Examples of Past pyOpenSci Reviews

It might be helpful to consult some previous reviews and read about the
experiences of other reviewers. In general you can find submission threads of
onboarded packages here. Here are a few chosen examples of reviews (note that
your reviews do not need to be as long as these examples):


* `MovingPandas` [review 1](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/18#issuecomment-579520816) and [review 2](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/18#issuecomment-581752433)

* `Pandera` [review 1](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/12#issuecomment-527622205) and [review 2](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues/12#issuecomment-531491008)



### Lessons Learned from rOpenSci

You can read blog posts written by reviewers about their experiences [via this link](https://ropensci.org/tags/reviewer/). In particular, in [this blog post by Mara Averick](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/08/22/first-package-review/) read about the "naive user" role a reviewer can take to provide useful feedback even without being experts of the package's topic or implementation, by asking themselves _"What did I think this thing would do? Does it do it? What are things that scare me off?"_. In [another blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/08/first-review-experiences/) Verena Haunschmid explains how she alternated between using the package and checking its code.

As both a former reviewer and package author [Adam Sparks](https://adamhsparks.com) [wrote this](https://twitter.com/adamhsparks/status/898132036451303425) "[write] a good critique of the package structure and best coding practices. If you know how to do something better, tell me. It’s easy to miss documentation opportunities as a developer, as a reviewer, you have a different view. You’re a user that can give feedback. What’s not clear in the package? How can it be made more clear? If you’re using it for the first time, is it easy? Do you know another R package that maybe I should be using? Or is there one I’m using that perhaps I shouldn’t be? If you can contribute to the package, offer."


### Feedback on the Process

We welcome any feedback and/or questions about the review process! We encourage you to open an issue on our [governance repository](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/governance/issues/new).

## Submitting the Review
- When your review is complete, paste it as a comment into the package software-review issue.
- Additional comments are welcome in the same issue. We hope that package reviews will work as an ongoing conversation with the authors as opposed to a single round of reviews typical of academic manuscripts.
- You may also submit issues or pull requests directly to the package repo if you choose, but if you do, please comment about them and link to them in the software-review repo comment thread so we have a centralized record and text of your review.
- Please include an estimate of how many hours you spent on your review afterwards.

## Review Follow-Up
Authors should respond within 2 weeks with their changes to the package in response to your review. At this stage, we ask that you respond as to whether the changes sufficiently address any issues raised in your review. We encourage ongoing discussion between package authors and reviewers, and you may ask editors to clarify issues in the review thread as well.
