# How Are JOSS, rOpenSci and pyOpenSci Related? 

## How is pyOpenSci different from JOSS and other review processes?

pyOpenSci aligns closely with the broad mission of JOSS to provide maintainers with credit for their efforts in developing the open source
tools necessary to support reproducible open science workflows. However, 
we are not a typical publisher or Journal. Rather we are a community 
that provides support for both a diverse group of software maintainers and 
long term maintenance of our packages.

### Why Two Review Processes JOSS and pyOpenSci? 

The pyOpenSci review process is different from that of JOSS in a few ways:

1. Our review is specifically design to enforce modern, community-accepted best practices for Python packaging. 
1. pyOpenSci places heavy emphasis on documentation and usability in our reviews and associated standardization of both.
1. pyOpenSci builds community around and visibility for its tools.
1. We will promote packages and package maintainers once they are accepted into our ecosystem.  
1. We support long term maintenance of packages. If the maintainer needs to step down, we will ensure a new maintainer takes over OR sunset and remove the package from our ecosystem.
1. We provide a welcoming forum to ask questions and get help with maintaining your package as needed.  

JOSS reviews are  also [more limited in scope](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html) compared to pyOpenSci and the
[submission criteria](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html)
are, in places, less stringent than those of pyOpenSci.

### JOSS is a Journal and a Publisher 

The JOSS review process is about publication. A review from JOSS will 
provide you with a citable DOI that is cross-ref
enabled.

## You can publish in both JOSS and be reviewed by pyOpenSci 

You don't have to chose between pyOpenSci and JOSS; You can submit your package to both.

pyOpenSci and [the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://joss.theoj.org/)
are complementary, partner organizations; and you don't have to chose one or the 
other! After a package to pyOpenSci has been reviewed and accepted by pyOpenSci
you can chose to also register it with JOSS. JOSS has [more limited scope](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html)  of the 
for packages that it will review. For instance while pyOpenSci will review and 
accept API wrappers, JOSS won't. 

If your package is accepted by pyOpenSci and in scope for JOSS, JOSS will fast 
track your package through their process given it was already reviewed by us.
Once accepted by JOSS, you now have both a pyOpenSci acceptance and one by JOSS. 
Joss will then give you a cross-ref supported DOI for citation.
